# React Suspense in Practice

Suspense enables smoother loading by letting you stream UI progressively.

## Where to Start

- Put boundaries at route/page level for coarse loading
- Use component-level boundaries for slow widgets (charts, comments)
- Pair with `ErrorBoundary` for robust recovery

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <UserProfile id={id} />
</Suspense>
```

## With Server Components

- Fetch on the server by default; stream to the client
- Keep client components lean; pass serialized data props

```tsx
// Server Component
export default async function Page() {
  const user = await getUser()
  return <UserInfo client user={user} />
}
```

## Anti‑patterns

- Nesting too many small boundaries (jittery UI)
- Triggering client fetches inside Suspense without coordination

## Tooling Tips

- React DevTools Profiler to verify waterfalls are gone
- Use network throttling to validate fallback durations

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <UserProfile id={id} />
</Suspense>
```
