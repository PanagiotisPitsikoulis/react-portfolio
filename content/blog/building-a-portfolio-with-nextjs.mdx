# Building a Portfolio with Next.js

A pragmatic walkthrough of architecture, content modeling with MDX, and the polish that helps your work stand out.

## TLDR

- **Stack**: Next.js App Router, MDX for content, Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Goals**: Fast, SEO-friendly, maintainable content, great DX
- **Results**: Core Web Vitals green, <200ms TTFB on Vercel, easy authoring

## Architecture

- App Router with route groups for `blog` and `projects`
- MDX-powered content with typed frontmatter
- File-system routing, incremental static regeneration for content
- Centralized design tokens and components

```tsx
// app/(sidebar)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (excerpt)
export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getContent('blog', params.slug)
  return <Mdx content={post.content} frontmatter={post.frontmatter} />
}
```

## Content Model

Frontmatter keeps listings fast and consistent:

```yaml
title: "Post Title"
date: "2025-05-22"
summary: "One-line summary"
tags: ["react", "nextjs"]
cover: "https://…"
authorName: Panos Pitsikoulis
```

## Performance Checklist

- Use `next/image` for covers and previews
- Generate responsive `sizes` for lists vs. detail
- Prefer static data (build-time) where possible
- Keep hydration minimal; ship server components by default

## SEO & Social

- Dynamic `metadata` per route (title, description, og:image)
- Canonicals and `robots` tuned for content pages

## Deployment

- Vercel for edge-cached static routes and on-demand revalidation
- Preview deployments for content reviews

## Lessons Learned

- Invest in content primitives once; iterate quickly after
- Centralize landing data; avoid hardcoding across components

## What’s Next

- Add RSS/Atom feeds and sitemap automation
- Authoring preview mode hooked to MDX
