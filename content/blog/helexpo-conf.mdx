# From Intern to Insight: My Experience at HELEXPO’s Logistics & Renewable Energy Expo

This past week, I had the incredible opportunity to represent Culture for Climate Actions AMKE as an intern at HELEXPO Thessaloniki, actively participating in two major events:

- The Logistics Expo and MENTOR‑CHAIN Conference
- Forward Green & Renewable EnergyTech Expo

As someone passionate about tech, sustainability, and innovation, this experience gave me front‑row access to some of the most exciting developments in green technology, ESG reporting, and logistics digitization.

## My Role & Activities

Under the guidance of Dr. Vyron Pissalidis (Founder/CEO of Culture for Climate Actions), I had the chance to:

- Assist in setting up our booth and preparing materials that showcased our innovative C‑ESG Compass Framework, a tool designed to guide organizations in creating effective and transparent sustainability reports.
- Support the team during the MENTOR‑CHAIN Conference organized by O.MIND Creatives and Supply Chain & Logistics Magazine, which focused on “Digital Transformation in Logistics and Human Resource Adaptation.”
- Participate in B2B meetings during the Forward Green Expo, helping our team connect with stakeholders, startups, and NGOs in the fields of renewable energy, circular economy, and digital ESG solutions.
- Engage in conversations with professionals such as Anestis Magganaris (Mentor Chain) and Kyriakos Damianidis (Entersoft), gaining insight into how large‑scale logistics platforms are embracing ESG and digital tools.

## Key Takeaways

### The Future of Logistics is Digital & Green
I learned how logistics companies are transitioning toward smarter systems with integrated sustainability metrics—from tracking carbon impact to AI‑assisted supply chains.

### ESG Reporting is Becoming Business‑Critical
The C‑ESG Compass we showcased allows organizations to assess their sustainability efforts in a structured way. It's no longer just a nice‑to‑have—it’s a must for modern, responsible organizations.

### Soft Skills Matter Just as Much
This experience helped sharpen my communication and networking skills. I saw how professionals present ideas, negotiate partnerships, and create value through collaboration.

### Events Like These Are Ecosystems of Innovation
It was inspiring to be part of an environment filled with entrepreneurs, engineers, policy makers, and climate advocates—all working toward a more sustainable future.

## A Step Forward

This internship wasn’t just an event — it was a launchpad. It pushed me out of my comfort zone, exposed me to real‑world innovation, and deepened my understanding of the intersection between tech, sustainability, and social responsibility.

I'm incredibly grateful to Dr. Vyron Pissalidis and the team at Culture for Climate Actions for giving me this chance to grow, contribute, and connect.

Looking forward to continuing on this journey and applying what I’ve learned to future tech, sustainability, and ESG‑driven projects.
