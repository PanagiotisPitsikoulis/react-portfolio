# Blink Calendar Overview

## The motivation for building this project

We all know the hassle of managing appointments and schedules, especially when it comes to clients having their first tattoo. They have to remember the date and time of their appointment as well as the location of the studio.

This leads to missed appointments, frustrating both clients who have to rejoin a long waitlist, as well as artists who have to reschedule their appointments and potentially lose revenue.

Obviously, many solutions exist to solve this problem, but none of them are tailored to the specific needs of a tattoo studio. They have complex ui that requires training for the staff and are not free of charge.

Therefore, I volunteered to build this project for [Blink Tattoo](https://www.blinktattoo.gr/). It is a web application, that adds appointment details to the users apple or google calendar through scanning a QR Code.

# Technical challenges and considerations

Even though this seems like a simple project, there were limitations that forced me to think out of the box. Through a careful planning stage I was able to arrive to these solutions.

|Challenge|Solution|
|---|---|
|Blink Calendar had to be very lightweight, used exclusively on mobile devices.|Used Tailwind CSS and Next.js with SSR.|
|The UI had to be very intuitive and easy to use, with a focus on simplicity, able to be used by anyone.|Tailwind CSS & ShadCN/UI.|
|Needs to pass information to the clients phone without a backend|Put all the information in a QR Code. ðŸ˜­|
|It had to be able to be hosted on any free hosting service, since it is a volunteer project.|Vercel.|

# Key Features
On the table that follows, the main features of this web application are highlighted.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Appointment Sync | Clients can add their session directly to Google Calendar or Apple Calendar. |
| Intiutive Admin Panel. | Employees fill a very simple form on their phone and are then presented with a QR code for the customer to scan. |
| Minimal Design. | Features a dark mode toggle, very readable and easy to use in any screen size.|
| Localization | The website can toggle between English and Greek with the press of a button |
| Studio Branding. | Layout, fonts, and colors match Blink Tattooâ€™s aesthetic. |
| Google/Apple Maps Integration. | Clients get instant directions to the studio. |

# Code Preview

I have released the source code of this project on github. If you do not have the time to go through it, you can have a preview down below.


``` typescript
export function createCalendarUrls(
  date: Date,
  time: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  location: string
) {
  if (!date || !time) return { google: "", apple: "", icsContent: "" };

  // Create event start and end time
  const [hours, minutes] = time.split(":");
  const startDate = new Date(date);
  startDate.setHours(parseInt(hours), parseInt(minutes), 0, 0);
  const endDate = new Date(startDate);
  endDate.setHours(startDate.getHours() + 1);

  // Format dates
  const startFormatted = startDate
    .toISOString()
    .replace(/[-:]/g, "")
    .replace(/\.\d{3}/g, "");
  const endFormatted = endDate
    .toISOString()
    .replace(/[-:]/g, "")
    .replace(/\.\d{3}/g, "");

  const coordinates = {
    lat: 40.62999,
    lng: 22.95042,
  };

  // Simplified map URLs
  const googleMapsUrl = `https://maps.app.goo.gl/JN3CLUQ4janyyGrZ8`;
  const appleMapsUrl = `https://maps.apple.com/?ll=${coordinates.lat},${coordinates.lng}&q=Blink+Tattoo+Studio`;

  // Shorter description for QR codes
  const mapInfo = `\n\nFind us on Maps:\n${googleMapsUrl}`;

  // Google Calendar URL
  const googleParams = new URLSearchParams({
    action: "TEMPLATE",
    text: title,
    details: description + mapInfo,
    location: location,
    dates: `${startFormatted}/${endFormatted}`,
  });
  const googleUrl = `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?${googleParams.toString()}`;

  const icsContent = [
    "BEGIN:VCALENDAR",
    "VERSION:2.0",
    "CALSCALE:GREGORIAN",
    "METHOD:PUBLISH",
    "BEGIN:VEVENT",
    `DTSTART:${startFormatted}`,
    `DTEND:${endFormatted}`,
    `SUMMARY:${escapeIcsValue(title)}`,
    `DESCRIPTION:${escapeIcsValue(description + mapInfo)}`,
    `LOCATION:${escapeIcsValue(location)}`,
    `GEO:${coordinates.lat};${coordinates.lng}`,
    `URL;VALUE=URI:${appleMapsUrl}`,
    `UID:${Date.now()}-${Math.random()
      .toString(36)
      .substring(2)}@blink-calendar.vercel.app`,
    "END:VEVENT",
    "END:VCALENDAR",
  ].join("\r\n");

  const appleUrl = `data:text/calendar;charset=utf-8,${encodeURIComponent(
    icsContent
  )}`;

  return { google: googleUrl, apple: appleUrl, icsContent };
}
```
