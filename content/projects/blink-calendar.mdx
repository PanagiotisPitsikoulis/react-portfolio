## Overview

Volunteer project for [Blink Tattoo](https://www.blinktattoo.gr/).

Blink is an appointment‑scheduling platform purpose‑built for Blink Tattoo, a tattoo studio in Thessaloniki, Greece. Powered by Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS, and polished with shadcn/ui, it combines an intuitive UI with automatic QR‑code check‑ins and real‑time calendar sync.

## Why Blink exists

Phone calls, DMs, and notebooks invite double bookings and missed reminders. Blink was shaped by conversations with artists who needed a tool as flexible as their workflow—but as reliable as a professional calendar. The goal: remove admin overhead so artists focus on design, not logistics.

## Key user‑facing benefits

### Appointment visibility & management
A self‑serve portal shows upcoming sessions with date, time, and notes—reducing no‑shows.

### Google & Apple calendar integration
Studio bookings sync to artists’ calendars via secure OAuth (Google Calendar) or downloadable ICS.

### Dark & light modes
Theme switcher supports bright studios and dim environments with clear, accessible contrast.

## Technical architecture

### Next.js foundations
Server‑side rendering for fast loads and SEO. ISR keeps marketing pages fresh while APIs remain real‑time.

### Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
Utility‑first styles with accessible, consistent components—buttons, date pickers, dialogs, and more.

### State management strategy
Lightweight React context orchestrates calendars, forms, and modal flows. Memoized hooks keep date logic snappy on mobile.

## QR codes: bridging online booking with in‑studio check‑in

Each booking generates a unique QR that embeds the appointment ID. On arrival, a quick scan surfaces the record in the admin panel and marks the client as Checked‑In—no paper forms or manual searches.

## Solving real studio pain points

By unifying visual scheduling, reminders, calendar sync, and QR verification, Blink eliminates double bookings, missed appointments, and miscommunication—returning time to artists and a polished experience to clients.
