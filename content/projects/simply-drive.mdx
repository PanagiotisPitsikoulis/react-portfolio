# SimplyDrive.gr Overview

## The motivation for building this project

Every year, thousands of Greek learner drivers struggle with memorizing the complex Κ.Ο.Κ. (Highway Code) road signs and traffic rules. Traditional study methods involve heavy books, static flashcards, and generic quiz apps that don't cater to Greek traffic laws and road signs.

Most existing apps are either too expensive, lack proper Greek localization, or don't provide intelligent explanations when students get answers wrong. Students often give up or fail their driving tests multiple times, leading to frustration and additional costs.

I wanted to create a free, intelligent study platform specifically designed for Greek driving theory that would make learning engaging, accessible, and effective. SimplyDrive.gr uses AI to provide personalized explanations in Greek and works seamlessly offline, ensuring students can study anywhere, anytime.

# Technical challenges and considerations

Building a comprehensive driving theory app with offline capabilities and AI integration presented several unique challenges that required innovative solutions.

|Challenge|Solution|
|---|---|
|Need for fast performance on mobile devices with poor connectivity|Implemented Next.js 14 with Partial Prerendering (PPR) and aggressive caching strategies.|
|Providing intelligent, context-aware explanations in Greek|Integrated OpenAI API with custom prompts optimized for Greek traffic law explanations.|
|Ensuring the app works offline for students without reliable internet|Built a robust Service Worker with Background Sync and localStorage for offline functionality.|
|Handling real-time progress tracking without constant server requests|Implemented optimistic SWR store with client-side state reconciliation.|
|Securing user data and preventing unauthorized access|Custom JWT authentication with HTTP-only cookies and comprehensive security headers.|
|Supporting thousands of concurrent users during exam periods|Used Prisma with PostgreSQL and PgBouncer for connection pooling and optimal performance.|

# Key Features

The platform offers a comprehensive set of features designed to make Greek driving theory learning as effective and accessible as possible.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| AI-Powered Explanations | Get detailed explanations in Greek for every question using OpenAI, with 24-hour caching for performance. |
| Offline Mode | Study without internet connection with Service Worker caching and background sync for seamless experience. |
| Real-time Progress | Track your learning progress with instant feedback and optimistic UI updates. |
| Greek Localization | Fully localized interface and content specifically designed for Greek Highway Code (Κ.Ο.Κ.). |
| Secure Authentication | Custom authentication system with JWT tokens and comprehensive security measures. |
| Progressive Web App | Install on mobile devices for native app-like experience with offline capabilities. |
| Performance Optimized | Sub-second load times with Partial Prerendering and intelligent caching strategies. |
| Comprehensive Analytics | Track learning patterns and weak areas with detailed progress analytics. |

# Code Preview

The application showcases several innovative technical implementations. Here are some key code snippets that power the platform.

## Optimistic SWR Implementation

```typescript
export function useOptimisticAnswers() {
  const { data: answers, mutate } = useSWR('/api/answers', fetcher);
  
  const submitAnswer = useCallback(async (questionId: number, selectedAnswer: number) => {
    // Optimistic update
    const optimisticAnswer = {
      id: Date.now(),
      questionId,
      selectedAnswer,
      isCorrect: null, // Will be determined by server
      timestamp: new Date()
    };
    
    mutate([...answers, optimisticAnswer], false);
    
    try {
      const result = await fetch('/api/submit-answer', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ questionId, selectedAnswer })
      });
      
      const serverAnswer = await result.json();
      
      // Reconcile with server response
      mutate(answers.map(a => 
        a.id === optimisticAnswer.id ? serverAnswer : a
      ));
      
      return serverAnswer;
    } catch (error) {
      // Revert optimistic update on error
      mutate(answers);
      throw error;
    }
  }, [answers, mutate]);
  
  return { answers, submitAnswer };
}
```

## AI Explanation Generation

```typescript
export async function generateExplanation(question: Question, userAnswer: number) {
  const prompt = `
    Ερώτηση Κ.Ο.Κ.: ${question.text}
    Σωστή απάντηση: ${question.correctAnswer}
    Απάντηση χρήστη: ${userAnswer}
    
    Δώσε μια σύντομη (75 λέξεις) εξήγηση στα ελληνικά που να:
    1. Εξηγεί γιατί η σωστή απάντηση είναι σωστή
    2. Αναφέρει το σχετικό άρθρο του Κ.Ο.Κ. αν είναι δυνατό
    3. Δίνει πρακτικές συμβουλές για την οδήγηση
  `;
  
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    max_tokens: 150,
    temperature: 0.7
  });
  
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

## Service Worker for Offline Support

```typescript
// service-worker.js
const CACHE_NAME = 'simplydrive-v1';
const OFFLINE_QUEUE = 'offline-queue';

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  if (event.request.method === 'POST' && event.request.url.includes('/api/submit-answer')) {
    event.respondWith(
      fetch(event.request).catch(() => {
        // Queue for background sync
        return self.registration.sync.register(OFFLINE_QUEUE);
      })
    );
  } else if (event.request.destination === 'document') {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request)
        .then(response => response || fetch(event.request))
        .catch(() => caches.match('/offline'))
    );
  }
});

self.addEventListener('sync', event => {
  if (event.tag === OFFLINE_QUEUE) {
    event.waitUntil(processOfflineQueue());
  }
});
```
