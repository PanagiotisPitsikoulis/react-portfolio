## Overview

Sidekick is the codebase behind this portfolio—a modern, MDX‑powered template built with Next.js 14 and React Server Components. It ships with a beautiful UI, first‑class SEO, and a streamlined writing workflow for blog posts and project pages.

## Highlights

- **MDX content engine**: Author posts and projects from `content/blog` and `content/projects` with frontmatter.
- **Post viewer UX**: Filters, tags, and pagination for browsing content efficiently.
- **SEO out of the box**: `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and `feed.xml` routes preconfigured.
- **Social previews**: Automatic Open Graph images via image generation endpoints.
- **Refined UI**: shadcn/ui + Radix primitives, responsive Tailwind design, dark/light themes.
- **Command bar**: Fast navigation and actions from anywhere on the site.
