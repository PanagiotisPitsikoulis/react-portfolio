# Mani Fishing Cruises Overview

## The motivation for building this project

Traditional fishing charter businesses in Greece, especially in remote areas like the Mani Peninsula, struggle with limited online presence and outdated booking systems. Many rely solely on word-of-mouth and local tourist agencies, missing out on direct bookings from international visitors who research and book activities online.

Captain Antonis from Mani Fishing Cruises had built an incredible reputation locally over 15+ years, but potential customers couldn't easily find information about his services, available trips, or how to make reservations. Most inquiries came through phone calls in Greek, creating language barriers for international tourists.

The tourism industry in Greece increasingly demands professional online presence, especially post-COVID when digital booking became essential. I partnered with Captain Antonis to create a modern, bilingual platform that showcases the authentic fishing experience while making it easy for tourists worldwide to discover and book their adventure in the pristine waters of Mani.

# Code Preview

The website demonstrates modern web development techniques optimized for tourism and local business needs. Here are key implementations.

## Dynamic Trip Showcase with MDX

```typescript
// app/trips/[slug]/page.tsx
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
import { getTrip, getAllTrips } from '@/lib/trips';
import { MDXContent } from '@/components/mdx-content';

interface TripPageProps {
  params: { slug: string };
}

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const trips = await getAllTrips();
  return trips.map((trip) => ({
    slug: trip.slug,
  }));
}

export async function generateMetadata({ params }: TripPageProps) {
  const trip = await getTrip(params.slug);

  if (!trip) return {};

  return {
    title: `${trip.title} | Mani Fishing Cruises`,
    description: trip.summary,
    openGraph: {
      title: trip.title,
      description: trip.summary,
      images: [
        {
          url: trip.cover,
          width: 1200,
          height: 630,
          alt: trip.title,
        },
      ],
    },
  };
}

export default async function TripPage({ params }: TripPageProps) {
  const trip = await getTrip(params.slug);

  if (!trip) {
    notFound();
  }

  return (
    <article className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
      <header className="mb-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">{trip.title}</h1>
        <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground mb-6">{trip.summary}</p>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
          {trip.highlights.map((highlight) => (
            <span
              key={highlight}
              className="bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm"
            >
              {highlight}
            </span>
          ))}
        </div>
      </header>
      <MDXContent source={trip.content} />
    </article>
  );
}
```

## WhatsApp Integration for Instant Booking

```typescript
// components/contact/whatsapp-button.tsx
'use client';

import { MessageCircle } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

interface WhatsAppButtonProps {
  tripName?: string;
  date?: string;
  guests?: number;
}

export function WhatsAppButton({ tripName, date, guests }: WhatsAppButtonProps) {
  const handleWhatsAppClick = () => {
    const phoneNumber = '306986847465'; // Captain Antonis' number

    let message = 'Hello! I would like to book a fishing trip with Mani Fishing Cruises.';

    if (tripName) {
      message += `\n\nTrip: ${tripName}`;
    }
    if (date) {
      message += `\nPreferred Date: ${date}`;
    }
    if (guests) {
      message += `\nNumber of Guests: ${guests}`;
    }

    message += '\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!';

    const encodedMessage = encodeURIComponent(message);
    const whatsappUrl = `https://wa.me/${phoneNumber}?text=${encodedMessage}`;

    window.open(whatsappUrl, '_blank');
  };

  return (
    <Button
      onClick={handleWhatsAppClick}
      className="bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white"
      size="lg"
    >
      <MessageCircle className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
      Book via WhatsApp
    </Button>
  );
}
```
