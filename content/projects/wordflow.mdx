## Overview

Wordflow is a website control panel, built with Payload CMS + Next.js, that reimagines content management: app‑like speed, instant edits, and intelligent features—without plugins or setup. Backed by AWS and edge delivery, it brings seamless AI integration and global performance to everyone.

## Highlights

- **App‑like sites**: Gesture‑rich, fluid browsing that feels like a native iPhone app.
- **Lightning‑fast performance**: Edge delivery with instant page loads—think Google/YouTube fast.
- **Advanced features easily**: Add AI and dynamic capabilities in minutes, no boilerplate.

## Wordflow AI

Ask the built‑in assistant anything about your site or content. From copy refinement to structured data suggestions, Wordflow AI accelerates everyday tasks.

## Dashboard Showcase

An intuitive control center for building, editing, and monitoring your site—no reloads, no delays. Interactions are instantaneous; changes apply in real‑time so managing content feels as smooth as your favorite app.

## Features for Creators

1. **Drag‑and‑drop page builder**  
   Choose from 200+ pre‑built blocks. Click to edit images or text and publish instantly—no code.

2. **Professional design tools**  
   Theme Studio centralizes control of headers, footers, fonts, colors, and spacing in one place.

3. **Robust content management**  
   Manage pages, posts, media, categories, users, forms, and redirects from a unified dashboard.

4. **SEO & analytics**  
   Built‑in SEO panels for meta, badges, and keywords—no plugins. Track performance with clarity.

## Component Library

A curated library of reusable, accessible UI components. Authors compose pages from blocks with guardrails on spacing, typography, and semantics. New components ship via the design system and become immediately available in the editor.

## Internationalization

First‑class i18n across content and UI. Localized collections, translatable fields, and language‑aware routing let teams author once and publish everywhere.

## Component Previews

Live, on‑brand previews inside the dashboard. Editors see exactly how blocks render on site—no guesswork, no context switching.

## Technical

### Under the hood
Edge‑first architecture across Vercel and Cloudflare. Infrastructure powered by AWS for global reach and reliability.

### Capabilities

- **Edge‑first speed**: Next.js 14 Partial Prerendering (PPR) + ISR streams a static shell in ms and refreshes data on demand.
- **Built‑in security**: JWT auth, role permissions, rate‑limiting, daily encrypted backups, and WAF rules by default.
- **Mobile‑perfect**: Fluid layouts, smart image compression, and edge caching score 90+ on Core Web Vitals.
- **Instant load times**: Pre‑rendered shell streams in milliseconds and live data hydrates without spinners.
- **Effortless editing**: Visual, point‑and‑click editor ships changes in moments.
- **Zero‑downtime updates**: Background deploys and instant cache purge—no maintenance screens.

### Payload integration

- Collections for pages, posts, media, users, forms, redirects, and settings
- Blocks‑based page builder with strict typing and field validation
- Drafts, versions, scheduled publish, and fine‑grained access control
- Server Actions bridge Payload operations to the app for type‑safe CRUD
- Live preview channel wired to draft content for instant feedback
