## Overview

Live event streams with anomaly detection, alerting, and time window analysis. This project was built for a SaaS company that needed real-time visibility into their platform's performance, user behavior, and business metrics. The dashboard processes over 5,000 events per second and provides sub-second latency for critical metrics.

## The Challenge

The company was struggling with:

- **Delayed insights**: Metrics were 15-30 minutes old, making it impossible to respond to issues quickly
- **Data silos**: Different teams had access to different data sources, leading to conflicting reports
- **Alert fatigue**: Too many false positives from static thresholds
- **Scalability issues**: Existing solution couldn't handle the volume of events

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **Next.js 14** with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI development
- **Recharts** for interactive, responsive charts
- **Zustand** for lightweight state management
- **React Query** for server state synchronization

### Backend Infrastructure

- **Node.js** with Express for API endpoints
- **PostgreSQL** with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **WebSocket** connections for real-time data streaming
- **Apache Kafka** for event stream processing

### Data Pipeline

```

## Implementation Details

### Real-time Data Streaming

The core challenge was handling 5,000+ events per second without overwhelming the frontend. We implemented a multi-layered approach:

```typescript
// WebSocket connection management
class AnalyticsWebSocket {
  private ws: WebSocket;
  private reconnectAttempts = 0;
  private maxReconnectAttempts = 5;

  constructor(private url: string, private onMessage: (data: any) => void) {
    this.connect();
  }

  private connect() {
    this.ws = new WebSocket(this.url);
    this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      this.onMessage(data);
    };

    this.ws.onclose = () => {
      if (this.reconnectAttempts < this.maxReconnectAttempts) {
        setTimeout(() => {
          this.reconnectAttempts++;
          this.connect();
        }, Math.pow(2, this.reconnectAttempts) * 1000);
      }
    };
  }

  public send(data: any) {
    if (this.ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      this.ws.send(JSON.stringify(data));
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Aggregation Strategy

Instead of sending raw events to the frontend, we implemented intelligent aggregation:

```typescript
// Server-side aggregation
interface AggregatedMetric {
  timestamp: number;
  value: number;
  count: number;
  min: number;
  max: number;
  avg: number;
}

class MetricAggregator {
  private buffers = new Map<string, number[]>();
  private interval: NodeJS.Timeout;

  constructor(private aggregationWindowMs: number = 5000) {
    this.interval = setInterval(() => this.flush(), this.aggregationWindowMs);
  }

  public addMetric(key: string, value: number) {
    if (!this.buffers.has(key)) {
      this.buffers.set(key, []);
    }
    this.buffers.get(key)!.push(value);
  }

  private flush() {
    for (const [key, values] of this.buffers) {
      if (values.length > 0) {
        const aggregated: AggregatedMetric = {
          timestamp: Date.now(),
          value: values.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0),
          count: values.length,
          min: Math.min(...values),
          max: Math.max(...values),
          avg: values.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / values.length,
        };

        this.broadcast(key, aggregated);
        this.buffers.set(key, []);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Anomaly Detection

We implemented a statistical approach to anomaly detection that adapts to each metric's behavior:

```typescript
class AnomalyDetector {
  private baseline: Map<string, number[]> = new Map();
  private threshold: number = 2.5; // Standard deviations

  public detectAnomaly(metricKey: string, value: number): boolean {
    const history = this.baseline.get(metricKey) || [];

    if (history.length < 10) {
      // Not enough data, add to baseline
      history.push(value);
      this.baseline.set(metricKey, history);
      return false;
    }

    const mean = history.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / history.length;
    const variance =
      history.reduce((acc, val) => acc + Math.pow(val - mean, 2), 0) /
      history.length;
    const stdDev = Math.sqrt(variance);

    const zScore = Math.abs((value - mean) / stdDev);

    // Update baseline (sliding window)
    history.push(value);
    if (history.length > 100) {
      history.shift();
    }
    this.baseline.set(metricKey, history);

    return zScore > this.threshold;
  }
}
```

### Chart Performance Optimization

With hundreds of data points updating in real-time, chart performance was critical:

```typescript
// Optimized chart component
const OptimizedChart = React.memo(({ data, config }: ChartProps) => {
  const chartRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);

  // Only render when visible
  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      ([entry]) => setIsVisible(entry.isIntersecting),
      { threshold: 0.1 }
    );

    if (chartRef.current) {
      observer.observe(chartRef.current);
    }

    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, []);

  // Throttle updates to 60fps
  const throttledData = useMemo(() => {
    if (!isVisible) return [];

    // Downsample data if too many points
    if (data.length > 1000) {
      return downsampleData(data, 1000);
    }
    return data;
  }, [data, isVisible]);

  if (!isVisible) {
    return <div ref={chartRef} className="h-64 bg-gray-100 animate-pulse" />;
  }

  return (
    <div ref={chartRef}>
      <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={256}>
        <LineChart data={throttledData}>
          <XAxis dataKey="timestamp" />
          <YAxis />
          <Tooltip />
          <Line type="monotone" dataKey="value" stroke="#8884d8" />
        </LineChart>
      </ResponsiveContainer>
    </div>
  );
});
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: WebSocket Scalability

**Problem**: Single WebSocket connection couldn't handle 5k+ events/sec
**Solution**: Implemented connection pooling and message batching

```typescript
class ConnectionPool {
  private connections: WebSocket[] = [];
  private currentIndex = 0;

  public broadcast(message: any) {
    // Round-robin distribution
    const connection = this.connections[this.currentIndex];
    if (connection?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      connection.send(JSON.stringify(message));
    }
    this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex + 1) % this.connections.length;
  }
}
```

### Challenge 2: Chart Rendering Performance

**Problem**: Charts became unresponsive with frequent updates
**Solution**: Implemented requestAnimationFrame and data throttling

```typescript
const useThrottledUpdate = (callback: () => void, delay: number) => {
  const lastRun = useRef(Date.now());

  return useCallback(() => {
    if (Date.now() - lastRun.current >= delay) {
      callback();
      lastRun.current = Date.now();
    }
  }, [callback, delay]);
};
```

### Challenge 3: Data Consistency

**Problem**: Real-time updates could cause race conditions
**Solution**: Implemented optimistic updates with conflict resolution

```typescript
const useOptimisticUpdate = <T>(key: string, updateFn: (oldData: T) => T) => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: updateFn,
    onMutate: async (newData) => {
      // Cancel outgoing refetches
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: [key] });

      // Snapshot previous value
      const previousData = queryClient.getQueryData([key]);

      // Optimistically update
      queryClient.setQueryData([key], newData);

      return { previousData };
    },
    onError: (err, newData, context) => {
      // Rollback on error
      queryClient.setQueryData([key], context?.previousData);
    },
  });
};
```
